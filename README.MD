### Description 
This is the personal project for me to understand how the encryption is implemented in the file level.
I am using the s-box with AES key for the encryption.

#### Progress
- [x] File reading
- [x] Generate new secure file
- [x] Generate new Secure Key of AES [128]
- [x] Byte modification with sub key index 0 for now
- [ ] implement s-box lookup table for the first round encryption
- [ ] sub bytes operation remaining
- [ ] Implement the decryption with the Symetric  key
